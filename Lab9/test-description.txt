test1.txt

this test maze does not contain any wall, 
this is to check if the logic of not escaping blocks 
and also to test if the graph starts from the correct row

test2.txt

this test maze contains a rock on 3rd block of escape row, 
it is to test if the graph traversal logic stops on rock
and reaches the other block when a rock is encountered
by deciding where is the rock.
eg. if rock is to top of the current block then the algorithm should add element below that rock


test3.txt

this is the test to check when other than on the escape row no other block can be escaped
the algorithm only makes a block if an escape from it is possible, so blocks which are rocks
will never escape, so the algorithm never creates a those vertex, 
this test also tests that the rock block should not be present in the graph, thus the reason for so many rock blocks
